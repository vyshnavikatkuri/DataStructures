We can sort a stack using recursion by following these steps:

Remove the top element from the stack.
Recursively sort the remaining stack.
Insert the removed element at its correct position in the sorted stack.
To insert an element at the correct position:

If the stack is empty or the element is greater than the top, push it.
Otherwise, pop the top element, insert the element, and push the popped element back.

Step-by-Step Execution
Remove 4, recursively sort {2, 5, 1, 3}
Remove 2, recursively sort {5, 1, 3}
Remove 5, recursively sort {1, 3}
Remove 1, recursively sort {3}
Remove 3, recursively sort {} (base case reached)
Now, we insert elements back in sorted order:

Insert 3: Stack → {3}
Insert 1: Stack → {1, 3}
Insert 5: Stack → {1, 3, 5}
Insert 2: Stack → {1, 2, 3, 5}
Insert 4: Stack → {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
