maximum no.of pieces can be cut in a cake using n cuts
formula=(n^2+n+2)/2;
This is derived from a mathematical formula for the maximum number of regions a circle can be divided into using N straight lines, assuming:

No two cuts are parallel

No three cuts intersect at the same point

Every new cut intersects all the previous cuts
